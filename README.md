# Graphism

An Elixir DSL that makes it easier to build Absinthe powered GraphQL apis 
on top of Ecto and Postgres.

## Installation :construction:

This library can be installed by adding `graphism` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:graphism, git: "https://github.com/gravity-core/graphism.git", branch: "main"}
  ]
end
```

Also add `:graphism` to your extra applications:

```elixir
 def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:graphism],
      ...
    ]
  end

```

## Your first schema :world_map:

Assuming you already have an Ecto repo, define a new schema module with your entities, attributes, relations and actions: 

```elixir
defmodule MyBlog.Schema do
  use Graphism,
    repo: MyBlog.Repo,
    otp_app: :my_app

    
  entity :post do
    string(:body)
    has_many :comments

    action(:read)
    action(:list)
    action(:create)
    action(:update)
    action(:delete)
  end

  entity :comment do
    string(:body)
    belongs_to :post

    action(:read)
    action(:list)
    action(:create)
    action(:update)
    action(:delete)
  end
end

```

Graphism will automatically add unique IDs as UUIDs to all entities in your schema.

## Generate migrations :building_construction:

Graphism will keep track of your schema changes and generate proper Ecto migrations:


First, you need to tell graphism about your schema. In your config.exs,


```elixir
config :graphism, schema: MyBlog.Schema
```

Then:

```
$ mix graphism.gen.migrations

```

Do not forget to run `mix ecto.migrate`.

## Expose your GraphQL api

You can use Graphism's convenience plug:


```elixir
defmodule MyBlog.Endpoint do
  use Plug.Router
  
  use Graphism.Plug, schema: MyBlog.Schema
end
```

This will make your GraphQL api available at `/api`. Also, you will have a GraphiQL UI at `/graphiql`. Internally, `Graphism.Plug` wraps `Abinsthe.Plug`.

Finally, you can easily add the endpoint to your supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyBlog.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      ...,
      {MyBlog.Repo, []},
      Plug.Cowboy.child_spec(
        scheme: :http,
        plug: MyBlog.Endpoint,
        options: [port: 4000]
      ),
      ...
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: Bonny.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

For convenience, `Plug.Cowboy` is automatically downloaded by Graphism, so you don't need to add it to your project.

## Observability

By default, Graphism embeds the great PromEx library in order to provide with built-in Prometheus metrics for all of your generated schema queries and mutations, but also for your Ecto repositories. 

For example, if your Graphism schema is `MyBlog.Schema`, then all your need to do is to add the generated 
module `MyBlog.Schema.Metrics` to the top of your supervision tree.

```elixir
defmodule MyBlog.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyBlog.Schema.Metrics,
      ...
    ]
    ...
  end
  ...
```

With this simple configuration, your metrics will be available at "/metrics". If you wished to customize 
the path, add the `metrics` option to your Graphism.Plug:

```elixir
use Graphism.Plug, schema: MyBlog.Schema, metrics: "/metrics/blog"
```

## Schema Features :abacus:

### Optional attributes

Any standard attribute can be made optional:

```elixir
entity :post do
  optional(boolean(:draft))
  ...
end
```

Optional attributes will not be required in mutations.

### Default values

It is possible to defined default values for attributes that are optional. 

```elixir
entity :post do
  optional(boolean(:draft), default: true)
  ...
end
```

For convenience, the above can also be expressed as:

```elixir
entity :post do
  optional(boolean(:draft, default: true)
  ...
end
```

### Computed attributes

Computed attributes are part of your schema, they are stored, and can also be queried.

However, since they are computed, they won't be included in your mutations, therefore it is not possible to modify their values explicitly.

```elixir
entity :post do
  computed(boolean(:draft, default: true)
  ...
end
```

### Standard actions

Graphism provides with five basic standard actions:

* `read`
* `list`
* `create`
* `update`
* `delete`

### User defined actions

On top of the standard actions, it is possible to defined custom actions:

```elixir
entity :post do
  ...
  action(:publish, using: MyBlog.Post.Publish, desc: "Publish a post") 
  ...
end
```

It is also possible to further customize inputs (`args`) and outputs (`:produces`) in custom actions:

```elixir
entity :post do
  ...
  action(:publish, using: MyBlog.Post.Publish, args: [:id], :produces: :post) 
  ...
end
```


It is essential to provide the implementation for your custom action as a simple `:using` Graphism hook.


### Hooks

Hooks are a mechanism in Graphism for customization. They are implemented as standard OTP behaviours.

Graphism supports the following types of hooks:

* `Graphism.Hooks.Simple` are suitable as `:using` hooks in custom actions.
* `Graphism.Hooks.Update` are suitable as `:before` hooks on standard `:update` actions. 
* `Graphism.Hooks.Allow` are suitable as `:allow` hooks in both standard or custom actions.

Please see the module documentations for further details.

## Github Workflow :dna:
Our commit convention follows [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) workflow.

### General commit message pattern
`type(scope?): description`

* `type` - Possible values are `feat | fix | refactor | perf | docs | style | test | chore | ci`.
* `scope` - Any scope to which `type` applies, usually we either omit scope or use the component name / part of the app name.
* `description` - Description of changes, needs to start with **lowercase** character to pass checks.

### Supported types:
 - **feat** - a new feature

  `feat(scope): description` or `feat: description`
 - **fix** - a bug fix

  `fix(scope): description` or `fix: description`
 - **refactor** - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

  `refactor(scope): description` or `refactor: description`
 - **perf** - a code change that improves performance

  `perf(scope): description` or `perf: description`
 - **docs** - documentation only changes

  `docs(scope): description` or `docs: description`
 - **style** - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

  `style(scope): description` or `style: description`
 - **test** - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

  `test(scope): description` or `test: description`
 - **chore** - other changes that don't modify src or test files

  `chore(scope): description` or `chore: description`
 - **ci** - changes to our CI configuration files and scripts

  `ci(scope): description` or `ci: description`

### Introducing breaking changes
We try to always provide backward-compatible changes to our API but, if itâ€™s necessary we might introduce a breaking change, we can do it by adding magic constant `BREAKING CHANGE` somewhere to commit description. This triggers `major` version bump to the package version.
